Utilities Pro
==========

Utilities Pro is a Java Runtime/ProcessBuilder tapper. It is to serve as a terminal in restricted enviornments, such as schools or universities. Tapping Java's ProcessBuilder or Runtime command system, its possible to bypass MCX, and most other controls on effective computer work.

Our release streams are as follows:
  * Master: Full Release, Along with .jar files on ifly6.no-ip.org. The master stream is the least updated of them, as it requires a passing of inspection, and is usually resulting from a merge from Beta into Master.
  * Beta: It is all development work. You will need to compile this yourself, and it will likely not work fully, unless it is declared as Major.Minor_dev# (however, there should be no versions which throw outright errors in Eclipse). Due to the change of the development cycle to Agile, there will be many, more frequent updates. The majority of them will likely be dev# versions, with Major versions released more unfrequently.
  
  * WinUtilities: This is an independent branch, not supported by the main team. Another team of programmers is working on porting Utilities Pro (or a significant part of it), into a Windows XP, Vista, 7 enviornment. This allows for cross-platform support for the programme. We do not expect that Linux users will necessarily require a programme like Utilities Pro, therefore, there is no port for Linux.
  
  All other branches are not qualified for official release.
