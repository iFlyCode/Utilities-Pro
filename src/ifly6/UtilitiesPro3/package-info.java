/**
 * Package contains all classes necessary to run UtilitiesPro.
 *
 * <p>
 * Utilities Pro was built not as an exercise in programming elegance and object-oriented programming, but rather as a
 * 'get it to work' program. Pretty much everything in the entire program is static with minimal non-static classes.
 * Furthermore, pretty much all classes are extended from the intial class. The reasons for doing so, given my lack of
 * programming expertise and only care for getting it to work, are obvious from the analytics of (1) hating long files
 * and (2) being annoyed at having to pass objects around. The extensions are all there to basically pretend that the
 * entire program is a massive set of methods all within the same class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Naturally, that is probably not a good way of looking at programming. For the archetypical object-oriented
 * programming language, it is probably not the best thing to treat it as if it were a gigantic massive file. But since
 * the entire program is built around executing functions all associated with the massive number of buttons in the
 * program and simply put, doing it cheap and fast, there are corners cut. For example, if I had the knowledge I have
 * today, I would have never built <code>ExecEngine</code> as an extension from <code>Utilities_Pro</code> or
 * <code>ScriptCommands</code> as a static system. I would have rather split them into files that would be instantiated
 * with properties set and executed much like the classes which manage files in Communiqu√© and iFly Region Protection.
