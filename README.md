Our release streams are as follows:

  * Beta: Should work (rarely, it does not), it is all cutting edge development work. You will need to compile this yourself.
  * Alpha (branch does not exist at most times): It shouldn't work. If it does, then its a miracle. Compile it yourself. It is only created when there is a major rewrite necessary, or restructuring.
  
  All other branches are not qualified for official release.
